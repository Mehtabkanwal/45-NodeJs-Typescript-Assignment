// Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.
function createCar(manufacturer, modelName, ...options) {
    const car = Object.assign({ manufacturer,
        modelName }, options.reduce((acc, option) => (Object.assign(Object.assign({}, acc), option)), {}));
    return car;
}
// Example usage:
const myCar = createCar("Toyota", "Camry", ["color", "Blue"], ["GPS", "Bluetooth"]);
// Print the car object
console.log("Car Information:");
console.log(myCar);
